//Push the value into the value property on the Heap 
//Bubble Up:
//1.Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1
//2.Create a variable called patentIndex which is the floor of (index - 1)/2
//3.Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index.
//4.Swap the value of the value
