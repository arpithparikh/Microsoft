//In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.


//Pseudocode for Basic Operations
//Insert
//Prepend(value)
//Contains(head,value)
//Remove(head,value)
//Traverse(head)
//ReverseTraversal(head,tail)


//Remove(head,value)
//Pre   : head is the head node in the list
//      : value is the value to remove from the list
//Post  : Value is the removed from the list, otherwise false


let even = {"abc":1}
let evenHead = even;

even.abc = 2; //interesting 

console.log(evenHead);


//For example: 'OF MICE AND MEN' and 'MEN IN BLACK' join to form 'OF MICE AND MEN IN BLACK'. 

//You could further join 'OF MICE AND MEN IN BLACK' with 'BLACK MASS' to form 'OF MICE AND MEN IN BLACK MASS'.   ----->Graph question
